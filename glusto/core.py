"""The brains of the Glusto toolset.

Glusto inherits from multiple classes providing configuration,
remote connection, and logging functionality and presents them in a single
global Class object. Glusto also acts a global class for maintaining state
across multiple modules and classes.

Example:
    To use Glusto in a module,
    import at the top of each module leveraging the glusto tools.::

        from glusto.core import Glusto as g
"""

from glusto.configurable import Configurable
from glusto.connectible import Connectible
from glusto.colorfiable import Colorfiable
from glusto.loggable import Loggable
from glusto.templatable import Templatable
from glusto.unittestable import Unittestable
from glusto.restable import Restable
from glusto.rpycable import Rpycable
from glusto.carteplex import Carteplex


# pylint: disable=too-many-ancestors
class Glusto(Configurable, Connectible, Colorfiable, Loggable,
             Templatable, Unittestable, Rpycable, Carteplex, Restable):
    """The locker for all things Glusto."""

    # TODO: figure out how we want to do this with cli options
    # TODO: call this after configs are read to be more effective
    # TODO: do this by default or force to be from main() or other importer
